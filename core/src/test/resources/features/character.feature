    When the character is standing
    Then current texture filename should be "mainCharacter/standing1.png"
    When the character updates its texture
    Then texture should be "mainCharacter/standing2.png"

    Then texture should be "mainCharacter/standing6.png"
    When the character updates its texture
    Then texture should be "mainCharacter/standing1.png"

  Scenario: Character walking
    Given I have a character at 0, 0
    When I move right
    Then the character should be at 1, 0
    When I move left
    Then the character should be at 0, 0
    When I move up
    Then the character should be at 0, 1
    When I move down
    Then the character should be at 0, 0

  Scenario: Character walks into wall to the right
    Given there is a wall at 1, 0 and a character at 0, 0
    When there is a colliding object to the right
    Then the character is colliding to the right

    When the character moves right
    Then the character should still be at 0, 0

    When the character moves left
    Then the character should not be colliding with right wall

    ##Walking into wall to the left
    Given there is a wall at 0, 0 and a character at 1, 0
    When there is a colliding object to the left
    Then the character is colliding to the left

    When the character moves left
    Then the character should still be at 1, 0

    When the character moves right
    Then the character should not be colliding with left wall

    ##Walking into wall to the top
    Given there is a wall at 1, 0 and a character at 0, 0
#    When there is a colliding object to the top

# Unit Tests
